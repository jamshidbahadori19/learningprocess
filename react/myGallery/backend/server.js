/* This This code sets up an Express server that listens on port 8000 or the port specified in the environment variable. It uses the dotenv package to load environment variables from a .env file. It also uses the cors package to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. The server is connected to a database using the connectDB function and uses a model to interact with the database. The server has a router that handles incoming requests. The server responds to requests with JSON data and uses the express.json() middleware to parse incoming JSON data. The server is started by calling the listen() method on the app object.*/
